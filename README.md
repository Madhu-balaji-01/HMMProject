# Hidden Markov Models 
## 50.007 Machine Learning Project
Our goal is to build a sequence labelling system from training data labelled with positive, neutral and negative sentiments and then use the system
to predict sentiment for new sentences. Specifically, we built two sentiment analysis systems
for two different languages - Spanish and Russian.

## Instructions to run the code
### Part 1
Run ```part1.py```. The generated output files ```dev.p1.out``` will be saved in the ES and RU directory respectively.

### Part 2 
Run ```part2.py```. When prompted for dataset, enter ```"ES"``` or ```"RU"``` in the command line to train on the ES and RU datasets respectively. The generated output files ```dev.p2.out``` will be saved in the ES and RU directory respectively.

### Part 3
Run ```part3.py```. When prompted for dataset, enter ```"ES"``` or ```"RU"``` in the command line to train on the ES and RU datasets respectively. The generated output files ```dev.p3.out``` will be saved in the ES and RU directory respectively.


### Part 4 - Structured Perceptron
 Run ```part4.py```. When prompted for dataset, enter ```"ES"``` or ```"RU"``` in the command line to train on the ES and RU datasets respectively. When prompted for mode, enter ```"dev"``` or ```"test"``` to get predictions on the development set and the test set respectively.
